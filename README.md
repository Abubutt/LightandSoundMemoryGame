## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. [The only outside source I used was youtube as I watched a couple of beginner HTML/CSS/Javascript videos.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) [The biggest challenge i had was implementing and understanding the javascript portion of this assignment. Creating the functions anf figuring out how to interact them with the objects was a little bit difficult. The way i overcame this challenge was by following the instructions which were very helpful and i also watched some videos which were very helpful.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) [The questions i have about web development is what is the main languages used, is it just HTML/CSS/Javascript? I am studying python and c++ so i was wondering if i would be able to implement these langauges into web development. Also is web development all web based apps or can they be used in conjunction with mobile.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) [If i had a few more hours i would spend time on changing the color scheme and the sounds that are played. Also i would add some new features like a score count that will allow the user to know what level they are on or how much they have left. Maybe have a bonus round which is super difficult. Also have a button that allows the user to cycle through different color schemes for the buttons and allow them to choose the one they like.]
